This is a FizzBuzz implementation built using TDD and SOLID design principles.

The initial focus was on setting up a test suite and creating a flexible structure using dependency injection and clear separation of responsibilities.

A separate branch was later added to demonstrate a version that uses Reflection to load rules dynamically, in line with the full requirements of the brief.
