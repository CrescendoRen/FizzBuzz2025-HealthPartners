This is an implementation of FizzBuzz approached using TDD and SOLID design principles

The initial focus was to set up a test suite and skeleton of a solution using flexible design and dependency injection to abide by SOLID principles

Later, a branch was added using Reflection to handle test design and load rules dynamically
